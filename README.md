# GOOGLE MAPS API - MILSTONE PROJECT 2
 
#### User-Centric Front-End Development Project

In this project, we were asked to create a single page application for a travel company. This application allows users to search for their
dream holiday destination, accomodation, nearby bars/restaurants and tourist attractions within that area. When planning your holiday you want to
know what there is to do. Where are the best places to eat/drink, where do people love to go? This application gives the user that exact 
infomation.

## UX DESIGN

This application isn't for those who wish to book a holiday, but gives them the opportunity to see the interesting and fun
places in the surrounding area of their desired destination. The user is able to see ratings of each hotel and restaurants, 
address and contact details also. 

### User Stories:

- As a User I want to be able to see other peoples reviews for specific places for example, a restaurant, so that I have a good understanding on whether or not that place would be worth going to.
- As a User I want to be able to search for specific areas, so that my searches aren't limited.
- As a User I want to search for bars and restaurants, so that I get an understanding of where places are so I can plan my stay.
- As a User I want to select a specific bar, restaurant or hotel and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be.
- As a User I thought it was a good idea to add a clock, but then spoke to multiple people and decided against and was a good decision to remove it.
- As a User I thought "hiding" the results table on smaller screens was a good idea as it looked untidy and messy.
