# GOOGLE MAPS API - MILSTONE PROJECT 2
 
#### User-Centric Front-End Development Project

In this project, we were asked to create a single page application for a travel company. This application allows users to search for their
dream holiday destination, accomodation, nearby bars/restaurants and tourist attractions within that area. When planning your holiday you want to
know what there is to do. Where are the best places to eat/drink, where do people love to go? This application gives the user that exact 
infomation.

## UX DESIGN

This application isn't for those who wish to book a holiday, but gives them the opportunity to see the interesting and fun
places in the surrounding area of their desired destination. The user is able to see ratings of each hotel and restaurants, 
address and contact details also. 

### User Stories:

- As a User I want to be able to see other peoples reviews for specific places for example, a restaurant, so that I have a good understanding on whether or not that place would be worth going to.
- As a User I want to be able to search for specific areas, so that my searches aren't limited.
- As a User I want to search for bars and restaurants, so that I get an understanding of where places are so I can plan my stay.
- As a User I want to select a specific bar, restaurant or hotel and get the correct contact details and address for that place, so that I can give a place a call to reserve a table if need be.
- As a User I thought it was a good idea to add a clock, but then spoke to multiple people and decided against and was a good decision to remove it.
- As a User I thought "hiding" the results table on smaller screens was a good idea as it looked untidy and messy.

## FEATURES

### Features Used in This Project:

- Able to search for any location in the world.
- Find the closest accomodation/bars/restaurants in that area.
- View the ratings of each hotel/bar/restaurant.
- View the contact details and address of each hotel/bar/restaurant.
- View and select the tourist attractions/points of interest within the specified area.
- Added reset button to refresh the page if you wish to restart your search.

## TECHNOLOGIES

### The Technologies I Have Used:

- **[Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)** - I have used the Google Maps API for use of their google maps service.
- **[Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)** - I have use the Google Places Api for use of their points of interest/hotels/bars to be added to my map.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/)** - I have used Bootstrap for it's grid system, making my application responsive.
- **[Boostrap Font Awesome](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/)** - I have used the Bootstrap Font Awesome CDN to make use of their social icons.
- **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)** - I have used jQuery for simplicity with my JavaScript. **jQuery I actually removed as I thought it would make the application slower and decided to use Vanilla JS.**
- **[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)** - I have use Balsamiq to create my Mockups for this application which can be found **[Here](https://github.com/CapitainHolmes/milestone-project-googleMaps/tree/master/mockups)**.


## TESTING

I conducted tests on a wide selction of browsers/devices to ensure User's can successfully use the site and it's features.

Tests conducted:

- Checking the functionality of the Google Maps Api, making sure everything worked as it should
- Making sure the code runs wihtout issues using the **[Google Chrome Inspect](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts)** Tools.
Inside Chromes Dev Tools I can:
    - Check the responsiveness for individual phones and screens, example, an IPhone/Samsung.
    - Use the console to check the stability of my **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)** files so that there is no errors and it is not broken.
    - I can also change and adapt my code inside the Tools, to see what works and what doesn't. Also staying aware that these changes I make are not permenant.

These tests included browsers/devices:

- Edge - laptop
- Mozilla - laptop
- Chrome - laptop and iPhone
- Safari - iPhone
- Internet Explorer - laptop

## DEPLOYMENT

Throughout the course of this project I have been commiting every finished functionality, every bug fix and things I thought needed removing, to GitHub
using **[Version Control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html)**.

I have fully deployed this application to GitHub Pages which can be found **[Here](https://capitainholmes.github.io/milestone-project-googleMaps/)**.

I did however use **[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)**'s Youtube Channel. 
Specificly his videos on the Google Maps API giving me a better insight, which can be found **[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxf1mnP5zcw&t=1355s)**.
